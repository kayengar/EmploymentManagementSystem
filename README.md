# EmploymentManagementSystem
Employement Management System is a JDBC application developed in the year 2011 using Core Java and Swing components. 

# This was developed in the year 2011 by me to demonstrate how an Employement Management System works by incorporating Java, MySQL and HTML. 

Two types of users can register in this application:
1. Job Seeker
2. Employee

# Steps to use:
1. While registering, the passwords are hashed using MD5 and stored in the MySQL database along with the username. The Job seeker fills his application stating all his preferences. Once the job seeker fills this info, it is available in the database.
The Employer can now filter and view all the job seeker's application that is relevant for them.

2. On clicking invite candidate, the candidate is invited for the interview. The candidaate needs to fil in a few info again and confirm his availaibility which is again sent as a message to the employer.
